# üç≠ Simple Emoji Picker

Linux ecosystem lacks a minimal and straight forward way to pick emojis. Some options are an overkill, others require multiple steps to simply get emoji into a clipboard. This simple tool aims fill the gap. The interface relies on an awesome [nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element](https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element) project. [Webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) was used to bundle the whole application into a single executable file.

Only Linux is currently supported. The rest of the platforms are covered natively.

## üì•Ô∏è Installation

Download file from releases section and run it.

```bash
curl -o emoji-picker https://github.com/va1da5/simple-emoji-picker/releases/download/v0.0.1/emoji-picker

sudo mv emoji-picker /usr/local/bin/emoji-picker
```

## ü§ó Usage

Once started, simply click on an emoji to copy it to a clipboard. Paste it later in any text editor.

The binary can later be configured to be started using a [keyboard shortcut](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/proc_setting-key-shortcut/), like `Crtl+Super+Space`, to make the process easier and similar to MacOS.

## üßÆ Development

The development of the utility could by done without Golang or Node environments when using Docker. [Makefile](./Makefile) contains all the commands to build executable using only containers. Please see details below.

```bash
make build-all
```

## üìù Todo

- [x] Disable Windows resize option while keeping the preferred window size
- [ ] Start application window near a mouse cursor - *harder than one would expect*
